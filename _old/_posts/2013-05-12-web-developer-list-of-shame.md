title: A Front-End Web Developer's List of Shame
summary: There is so much I don't know about web development. Here are the languages or practices I hope to learn in the near future.

* *Git & GitHub*  
My relationship with SubVersion (svn) has run its course. The new kid on the block isn't that new anymore and it's about time I take the bull by the horns and get my Git on! (WOW! Too many clich√©s in one sentence)
* *APIs*  
There are a ton of public APIs that allow developers to create amazing tools. I haven't figured out what I'm going to do with them, but I know I want to do something.
* *CSS Animations*  
I've barely scratched the surface at what can be done with CSS animations.
* *Angular.js*  
Simple and sweet way to dynamically update elements on the document.
* *Meteor*  
Yeah. That. I'll probably be boring and create a to-do list app or similar.

There is so much to learn and this list only scratches the surface.
