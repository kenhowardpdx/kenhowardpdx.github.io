title: Create Your Own Web Design Podcast Directory
summary: I love listening to podcasts during my commute to and from work. And I love finding new podcasts. But there isn't an up-to-date podcast directory that I rely on to discover new shows. Hence, create your own.

<h3>** Update **</h3>
<p>Shortly after I wrote this list of excellent web design related podcasts, <a href="http://webbypodcasts.co.uk/">Webby Podcasts</a> was released. Thanks for a great list, <a href="http://twitter.com/wesleyburden">Wesley</a>. I strongly recommend you check out Webby Podcasts as it has more podcasts listed along with ratings and analysis.</p>

One of my biggest complaints about podcasts is they don't sync across devices and platforms. I may be listening to [The Big Web Show](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow) while at work and head home before the show is over. If I want to keep listening to the show during my commute I open [BeyondPod for Android](http://www.beyondpod.com/Android/), and start playing the episode from there -- skipping ahead to where I left off.

But, what if I discover a new show while at work? I can easily subscribe to the podcast within iTunes, but what about subscribing to the podcast on my phone? The process becomes confusing to say the least. A mix of Google searching, long-pressing, copying, pasting, waiting for the feed to download, oh wait, you're not on Wi-Fi?

So, to make my life easier I will be adding show feeds to this page as I discover them so I can easily access them in the future from whatever device I'm using. If this benefits someone else in the process, cool!
