##Files & Directories
`ls` - Lists files in a given directory.  
`la` - Same as above, except this is a link to `ls -la` which shows all files (including hidden files) and their permissions.

**Usage**

```
$ ls ~ //Look in the current users home directory
Applications         Dropbox              Projects Archive
Creative Cloud Files Library              Public
Desktop              Movies               VirtualBox VMs
Documents            Music                bin
Downloads            Pictures             tmp
```

```

##Reading Files
`cat` - Outputs entire contents of a file to the terminal.  
`more` / `less` - Outputs the contents of a file to the terminal and breaks it into pages which you can scroll with arrow keys.

**Usage**

```
$ cat README.md
kenhowardpdx-blog
=================

My personal blog about Front-End Web Development and Web Design
```

<br />
##Editing Files
`vim`- As complex as you need it to be. I use it for simple editing.  
`echo` - Not really for editing, but you can use it to append to a file (add a new line).

**Usage**

```
$ echo "the string to add" >> myfile.txt
```
