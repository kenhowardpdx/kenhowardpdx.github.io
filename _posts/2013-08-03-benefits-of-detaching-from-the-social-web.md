title: Benefits of Detaching from the Social Web
summary: Life has a way of reminding you what is important. Social media has everyone fooled. While we believe we are building stronger relationships with eachother, we are actually weaking the relationships that are the most important to us.

This week has been trying. While preparing for our oldest daughters birthday and the inevitable arrival of our new baby boy, the challenges of work and finances have caused be to adjust my focus. I am spending less time on social networks, less time tweeting, less time "liking" irresistable cat photos, and less time reading blogs and news articles.

Instead, I have been engaging with my kids and my family. I even stepped out of my comfort zone and went to a meetup and shook a few hands. And, I watched a blockbuster while it was still playing in a theater.

So, in light of this, I conclude that social networks are an obsticle to enjoying real life. And I will make better use of my time.

Also, as a side note, my wife and I have discussed more than once the impact people you "friend" play in your real life. I urge you to read ["Press the Magic Button" by Derek Powazek](http://powazek.com/posts/2522) - **"one strike" rule for Twitter/Flickr and why you shouldn't be offended when someone blocks you.**
