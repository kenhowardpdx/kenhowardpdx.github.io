## Introducing SimpleHighlight.js

There are other jQuery plugins that do this very same thing except they require an object and only highlight as you type. So they aren't really useful for highlighting keywords in search results.

This plugin is the simplest version of those plugins. It can be used both as a keystroke highlighter and a search results highlighter.

[The SimpleHighlight.js Demo](/demos/simplehighlight/) shows how the plugin can be used for keystroke highlighting. You can enter your own text and keywords and see the output in real-time.
