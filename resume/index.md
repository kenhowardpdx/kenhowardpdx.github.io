I’m looking to work with creative people building amazing products with clean
interfaces. There’s more than one way to solve a problem and the best way to
solve it is with collaboration. I’m a collaborative team member vocal with my
opinions and willing to hear the opinions of others.

## Professional Experience
**Nike, Inc.** Beaverton, OR<br>
**Lead Software Engineer,** July 2017 - Present

* Establish an elite team with production deployments 10 to 20 times per day.
* Introduce and maintain strong coding standards and development conventions
to keep engineers focused on delivering business value.
* Migrate multiple legacy analytics instrumentations to a single pipeline to
drive personalization and business decisions.
* Build systems to catalog event definitions to inform stakeholders and product
owners about the shape of their events.
*  Build tools for engineers to understand their data and to know whether it is
valid or not.
* Work closely with application teams to adopt new analytics SDKs.

#### Key Projects

* **Nike-First Data Pipeline**<br>
A large portfolio of applications implemented analytics in different
ways. We were tasked with migrating all consumer-facing applications (Nike App,
NRC, NTC, nike.com, SNKRS) to a Nike-First Data Pipeline. Establishing our
pipeline meant we no longer had to support fragmented analytics and could start
to manage data as a product.

* **Adobe Analytics Integration**<br>
Applications have used Adobe Analytics SDKs for years. Like the Nike-First Data
Pipeline, applications Adobe Analytics configured differently which confuses
what the data means. By migrating away from the Adobe Analytics SDKs and away
from Segment destinations into a single microservice driven by property
mappings in our event definition catalog we were able to reduce complexity and
increase the confidence in the data business analysts use to make critical
decisions.
